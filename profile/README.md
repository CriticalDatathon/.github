# Critical Datathon 2023 :bar_chart:

Welcome to the Critical Datathon 2023 GitHub organization! :tada: We are hosting the 2023 MIT Critical Datathon on May 18-19th at Riverfront Office Park in Cambridge, MA. This is the main hub for repositories that host various datathon projects, resources, and tools.

Check out our website for more details: https://criticaldatathon.github.io/

## The Challenge :trophy:

The main challenge of this Datathon is to create Correction Models for Pulse Oximetry that map SaO2 from SpO2 measurements. Patients of color often have falsely elevated O2 readings due to limitations in pulse oximetry performance across different ethnicities. Our focus is on Patient Safety.

Participating teams will be composed of high school students and computer science undergraduate students. Mentors with expertise in Patient Safety will bring their unique perspectives, experience, and critical thinking to the table!

We believe that reproducible, transparent research can help advance the field, so all our code is open-source. All data preparation and team's code will be made available on GitHub.

## Overview of Repositories :file_folder:

Our repositories consist of projects, resources, and tools used during the datathon. Here's a brief overview of what you can find:

- **Team Repositories (team-1 to team-10)**: :chart_with_upwards_trend: These repositories contain notebooks assigned to each group of students participating in the datathon.
- **Workshops**: :books: This repository contains materials for the workshops held during the datathon.
- **Welcome Packages**: :gift: Welcome packages and orientation for [mentors](https://github.com/CriticalDatathon/welcome-mentors) and [students](https://github.com/CriticalDatathon/welcome-students) participating in the datathon.
- **Data Preparation**: :wrench: [Data-prep](https://github.com/CriticalDatathon/data-prep) repository contains code to curate ICU Pulse Oximetry data.
